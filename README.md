# Twitter-GOP-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
<p> Gated Recurrent Units are used to perform sentiment analysis on tweets from the GOP debate. The tweets were first processed to get rid of stop words after which porter stemmer was used. The tweets were then one hot encoded and padded to maintain uniform length of input vector. An embedding layer was used to learn the appropriate word representation by generating a dictionary from the given dataset. 

The model acheives a test set accuracy of 84.29%.</p>
